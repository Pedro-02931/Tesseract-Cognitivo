## Core Modules

Every library  include here is like a meticulously chosen tool when each one has a specific porpouse in this experiment. The goal  is to hijack classical computacional resources and bend them  into-pseudo-quantum machine, running quantum-like process without needing superconductors and entangled photons.

### Libriries

* `#include <stdio.h>`&#x20;
  * It handles standard I/O, but here it plays a bigger role: it'sthe primary interprater layer between our quantum-simulated model and the POSIX environment.
  * When the system generates an "emotional score", it's pipe out.
  * Functions like printf is NEEDED.
* `#include <stdlib.h>`
  * For memory managment when simulate quantum mechanics.&#x20;
  * `malloc`and `free`as used for managing superpositions.&#x20;
  * In a quantum sense, variables aren't static- they exist in potential states.
  * By allocating and freeing memory, the system creates temporary buffers that act like collapse wave function.
  * It's as if the system is generating and destroying quantum states on demand.
* `#include <math.h>`
  * When you dealing with quantum simulations, you need hardcore math.
  * Functions like `pow` and `sqrt` translate quantum amplituded and vector projections into tangible data.
  * Wheter it's thermal derivates or calculating the "emotional score", thats define states of device, this libriries is the mathematical operations thats emule abstract quantum theory into cold hard numbers.
* `#include <time.h>`
  * Time in classical computing is linear, but in quantum simulation, it's a variable.&#x20;
  * By using `time` and `localtime`, the system creates temporal markers that act as checkpoints for quantum state collapses.&#x20;
  * It's like creating save points in a game—only instead of saving your progress, it's saving the current state of the simulated quantum universe in kernel.
* `#include <unistd.h>`
  * This POSIX library is the glue between our system and the underlying OS.&#x20;
  * Functions like `sleep` and `usleep`are used to creating "decoherence delays."&#x20;
  * This gives the simulated quantum modules time to sync, ensuring that every component operates at the same frequency.&#x20;
* `#include <dirent.h>`
  * This library handles directory operations.&#x20;
  * But it’s not just to list files like a mundane sysadmin. This access external libraries and modules dynamically, as if the script is observing multiple possible realities (folders) and choosing the optimal path.&#x20;
  * It's like a quantum computer picking the best solution from a superposition of possible outcomes.
  * Folders work like tensors.&#x20;
    * When the script navigates through directories with dirent.h, it's not just searching for random files, but rather traversing a "superposition of states," as if each folder were an alternate version of a quantum universe.&#x20;
    * Depending on the conditions (such as the system's "emotional score" or thermal state), it chooses the most suitable tensor — the folder with the right module to load into memory.
  * Files works like neurons:
    * But they are not traditional neurons as in a shallow neural network.&#x20;
    * They carry not only the data, but also the processing logic.&#x20;
    * It's almost as if each file is an autonomous neuron, with its own synaptic rules.&#x20;
    * When the system "opens" a file, it not only loads the information, but also executes the rules that transform that information, as if it were a custom activation function.

### Constants:



* `#define BUFFER_SIZE 256`
  * Setting the buffer size is about limiting active memory space, simulating the observable universe's finiteness.&#x20;
  * In this quantum context, the buffer is a "measurement window" where only data within this space matter.&#x20;
  * The rest is quantum noise, automatically discarded like useless timelines in a multiverse.
  * Quantus principles:
    * Even
      * Even numbers represent stability, symmetry, and quantum collapse because they divide space into equal parts, creating a fixed reference point.&#x20;
      * They act as anchors in reality, where the wave function collapses and uncertainty is minimized.&#x20;
      * Odd
        * Odd numbers, on the other hand, live in superposition, in chaos theory, because they break this symmetry, generating unpredictable and complex patterns.&#x20;
        * It's like the paradox between order and entropy: the even number closes the wave function, the odd number keeps the system on the edge of chaos.
      * Why 256?
        * It is 2^8, that is, a power of two, which fits perfectly into the binary system.&#x20;
        * It creates an optimized memory structure, where each bit has an exact place, without waste or fragmentation.&#x20;
        * In practice, this transforms the buffer into a "quantum well", a quantum well where data (particles) are confined in a discrete and controllable state.&#x20;
        * Everything outside this space becomes quantum noise, cutting off the alternative realities and keeping only the most likely universe — "quantum collapse" in computational practice.



* `#define CRITICAL_TEMP 358.15`
  * Defining critical temperature in Kelvin ties directly into quantum thermodynamics.&#x20;
  * At 85°C, the system hits "critical mode," transitioning from normal operations to a resource conservation state.&#x20;
  * This is akin to a biological system going into homeostasis or a quantum particle hitting an energy threshold that forces a phase change.
  * Quantum principles:
    * Why kelvin?
      * Kelvin is used because it is the absolute temperature scale, where 0 K represents absolute zero, the point at which all molecular kinetic energy ceases.&#x20;
      * In quantum simulation, this is crucial, as it allows the thermal state to be directly mapped to the behavior of the particles, without relative or negative deviations.
      * The critical temperature of 358.15 K (85°C) acts as a quantum threshold: upon reaching this thermal energy, the system collapses to a "critical state", switching from an operational phase to a mode of extreme resource conservation.&#x20;
      * It is like tuning the energy of the system to the phase transition point, where even the computational processing behaves like a quantum particle at the limit of stability.
* `#define SAMPLING_INTERVAL 2`
  * This is the system’s measurement frequency, essentially the beat of the quantum drum.&#x20;
  * It dictates how often the system "collapses" its state and logs a new "measurement" of its universe. It’s the function wave’s cycle time, keeping stability without pushing the processor into a meltdown.
  * Quantum principles:
    * In quantum mechanics, frequency is basically the number of times a wave function oscillates per second.&#x20;
    * Each oscillation represents a quantum cycle, where the system transitions between superposition states and collapse into an observable state.
    * Every 2 seconds the system "hears" the sound of the drum, collapsing the quantum state into a specific reality and discarding alternative possibilities.
    * In practice, the frequency regulates the measurement rate, defining the pace at which the system processes reality and maintains stability without overloading the processing. It is the balance between the chaos of superposition and the order of quantum collapse.
    * Instead of allocating the entire memory space, you just collapse it into one state.
*   `define ALPHA 0.15` e `#define BETA 0.05`

    * These constants are weights for thermal derivative calculations. In the quantum frame, they act as "potentials" influencing the direction of wave function collapse.&#x20;
    * ALPHA and BETA introduce bias into the system, guiding how it reacts to thermal changes and preventing chaotic performance spikes. They are like quantum dials, setting the tilt of reality's seesaw.
    *   Quantum principles:

        * The concepts of even and odd connect directly to the idea of ​​quantum collapse (order) and superposition (chaos).&#x20;
        *   In quantum frequency, each oscillation cycle can be seen as a beat that alternates between these two states:



            * Even numbers: Represent the collapse of the wave function, where the system reaches a stable, predictable and measured state. It is like beating the drum at exactly the right rhythm, each beat being a "checkpoint" of reality.
            * Odd numbers: Represent chaos, superposition, where the system has not yet chosen a definitive state. It is the interval between the beats of the drum, where all possibilities are still in the air, with no defined collapse.
        * Now, when you connect this with the weights ALPHA and BETA, what you see is that these parameters act as a bias to define the behavior of the system in the face of this alternation.&#x20;
        * They incline the system to "prefer" to collapse into certain states (even) or to remain longer in superposition (odd).
        * In practice, this creates an oscillatory dynamic where the system dances between order and chaos, just like the even/odd cycle.&#x20;
        * With each beat of the quantum drum, the system decides whether to collapse into a state (even) or to keep the possibilities open (odd), using ALPHA and BETA as the "fine tuning" that determines this choice.
