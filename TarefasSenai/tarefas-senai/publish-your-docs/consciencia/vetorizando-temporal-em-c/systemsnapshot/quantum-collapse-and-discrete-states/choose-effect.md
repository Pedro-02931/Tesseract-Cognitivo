Before that, everything was just a cloud of potential, a Schrodinger's cat of system metrics, both optimal and dysfunctional until observed. Like, think of it this way, even numbers have no derivations, they are not broken, that is, a completely collapsed state that our cognition understands, while odd numbers have countless decimal values.

When the code mentions that the system "chooses a specific, determined value for each metric," it essentially locks the system into a fixed reality. The CPU frequency, which might have been in a superposition of states between 1 GHz and 3 GHz, now concretizes at 2.4 GHz, for example.&#x20;

This transition is not just a data capture but a **quantum event**â€”transforming abstract possibilities into concrete, actionable data. This is critical for **computational efficiency** because maintaining superposition requires more resources.&#x20;

By collapsing into a discrete state, the system cuts out the noise, focusing only on the current state and turning off unnecessary processes, whether on a server or on a smartphone, where at each moment it generates a unique state, like, in moments derived from biological inferences, like smartwatches, the system could disable apps and reduce brightness depending on user fatigue, with a minimum processing cost
